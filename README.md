## Basic User Journey
 A user comes to website, understands the potential of the website. 
Searches through the website with omnisearch, clicks one of the relevant results.
Goes to the page and sees the Doctor's, Clinic's, etc. message. Gets the trust / can-do
etc. feeling from the page and checks the prices. Starts end to end chat if it is 
enabled. (contact information is not visible in messages). Pays the price if everything 
is ok. Post purchase process begins. (All moves are tracked)
